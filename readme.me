Request: A client sends a request to the server.
Middleware: Functions that process the request. They can modify the request, perform operations, or call next() to pass control to the next middleware.
API Endpoint: A specific route handler (or controller) that generates a response based on the request. Itâ€™s the final part where the response is prepared.
Response: The server sends the response back to the client.

Sequence in Express:

Request arrives at the server.
Middleware functions process the request.
API Endpoint handles the request and generates a response.
Response is sent back to the client.
